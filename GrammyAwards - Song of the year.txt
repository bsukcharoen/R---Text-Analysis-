Long live the king!One minute I held the keyNext the walls were closed on meAnd I discovered that my castles standUpon pillars of salt and pillars of sandI hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Cavalry choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign fieldFor some reason I can't explainOnce you go there was never, never a honest wordAnd that was when I ruled the worldIt was a wicked and wild windBlew down the doors to let me inShattered windows and the sound of drumsPeople couldn't believe what I'd becomeRevolutionaries waitFor my head on a silver plateJust a puppet on a lonely stringOh, who would ever want to be king?I hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Calvary choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign fieldFor some reason I can't explainI know Saint Peter won't call my nameNever an honest wordBut that was when I ruled the worldOh, oh, oh, oh, ohI hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Calvary choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign fieldFor some reason I can't explainI know Saint Peter won't call my nameNever an honest wordBut that was when I ruled the world

Back when I was a childBefore life removed all the innocenceMy father would lift me highAnd dance with my mother and meAnd thenSpin me around 'till I fell asleepThen up the stairs he would carry meAnd I knew for sureI was lovedIf I could get another chanceAnother walkAnother dance with himI'd play a song that would never ever endHow I'd love love loveTo dance with my father againWhen I and my motherWould disagreeTo get my way I would runFrom her to himHe'd make me laugh just to comfort meyeah yeahThen finally make me doJust what my mama saidLater that night when I was asleepHe left a dollar under my sheetNever dreamed that heWould be gone from meIf I could steal one final glanceOne final stepOne final dance with himI'd play a song that would never ever end'Cause I'd love love love toDance with my father againSometimes I'd listen outside her doorAnd I'd hear how mama would cry for himI'd pray for her even more than meI'd pray for her even more than meI know I'm praying for much too muchBut could you send herThe only man she lovedI know you don't do it usuallyBut Dear LordShe's dying to dance with my father againEvery night I fall asleepAnd this is all I ever dream

I waited 'til I saw the sunI don't know why I didn't comeI left you by the house of funI don't know why I didn't comeI don't know why I didn't comeWhen I saw the break of dayI wished that I could fly awayInstead of kneeling in the sandCatching teardrops in my handMy heart is drenched in wineBut you'll be on my mindForeverOut across the endless seaI would die in ecstasyBut I'll be a bag of bonesDriving down the road aloneMy heart is drenched in wineBut you'll be on my mindForeverSomething has to make you runI don't know why I didn't comeI feel as empty as a drumI don't know why I didn't comeI don't know why I didn't come

Streets of Philadelphia
I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt.I was unrecognizable to myself.Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face.Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' awayOn the streets of Philadelphia.I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone,I heard the voices of friends, vanished and gone,At night I could hear the blood in my veins,It was just as black and whispering as the rain,On the streets of Philadelphia.Ain't no angel gonna greet me.It's just you and I my friend.And my clothes don't fit me no more,A thousand milesJust to slip this skin.Night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake,I can feel myself fading away,So receive me brother with your faithless kiss,Or will we leave each other alone like thisOn the streets of Philadelphia.

Well, it's not far down to paradise, at least it's not for meAnd if the wind is right you can sail away and find tranquilityOh, the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see.Believe me.It's not far to never-never land, no reason to pretendAnd if the wind is right you can find the joy of innocence againOh, the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see.Believe me.Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could beJust a dream and the wind to carry meAnd soon I will be freeFantasy, it gets the best of meWhen I'm sailingAll caught up in the reverie, every word is a symphonyWon't you believe me?Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could beJust a dream and the wind to carry meAnd soon I will be freeWell it's not far back to sanity, at least it's not for meAnd if the wind is right you can sail away and find serenityOh, the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see.Believe me.Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could beJust a dream and the wind to carry meAnd soon I will be free

What a fool believes
[Verse 1]He came from somewhere back in her long agoThe sentimental fool don't seeTryin' hard to recreateWhat had yet to be created once in her lifeShe musters a smile for his nostalgic taleNever coming near what he wanted to sayOnly to realize it never really was[Pre-Chorus]She had a place in his lifeHe never made her think twiceAs he rises to her apologyAnybody else would surely knowHe's watching her go[Chorus]But what a fool believes, he seesNo wise man has the power to reason awayWhat seems to beIs always better than nothingThan nothing at all[Verse 2]Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long agoWhere he can still believe there's a place in her lifeSomeday, somewhereShe will return

Love theme from a star is born (evergreen)
Love soft as an easy chairLove fresh as the morning airOne love that is shared by twoI have found with youLike a rose under the April snowI was always certain love would growLove ageless and evergreenSeldom seen by twoYou and I willMake each night the firstEveryday a beginningSpirits rise and their dance is unrehearsedThey warm and excite us'Cause we have the brightest loveTwo lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sunTime, we've learned to sail aboveTime, won't change the meaning of one loveAgeless and ever, evergreen

You light up my life
So many nights I'd sit by my windowWaiting for someone to sing me his songSo many dreams I kept deep inside meAlone in the dark but now you've come alongAnd you light up my lifeYou give me hope to carry onYou light up my days and fill my nights with songRollin' at sea, adrift on the waterCould it be finally I'm turnin' for home?Finally a chance to say "Hey, I love you"Never again to be all aloneAnd you light up my lifeYou give me hope to carry onYou light up my days and fill my nights with song'Cause you, you light up my lifeYou give me hope to carry onYou light up my days and fill my nights with songIt can't be wrongWhen it feels so right'Cause you…..you light up my life

I write the songs
We walked to the sea, just my father and meAnd the dogs played around on the sandWinter cold cut the air, hangin' still everywhereDressed in gray, did he say, "Hold my hand"I said, "Love's easier when it's far away"We sat and watched a distant lightWe're two ships that pass in the nightWe both smile and we say, "It's alright"We're still here, it's just that we're out of sightLike those ships that pass in the nightThere's a boat on the line where the sea meets the skyThere's another that rides far behindAnd it seems you and I are like strangers a wide ways apartAs we drift on through timeHe said, "It's harder now we're far away"We only read you when you writeWe're two ships that pass in the nightAnd we smile when we say it's alrightWe're still here, it's just that we're out of sightLike those ships that pass in the nightWe're just ships that pass in the nightAnd we smile when we say it's alrightWe're still here, it's just that we're out of sightLike those ships that pass in the nightWe're just two ships that pass in the nightAnd we smile when we say it's alrightWe're still here, it's just that we're out of sight

Send in the clowns

Killing me softly with his song
Strumming my pain with his fingers,Singing my life with his words,Killing me softly with his song,Killing me softly with his song,Telling my whole life with his words,Killing me softly with his songI heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.And so I came to see him to listen for a while.And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.Strumming my pain with his fingers,Singing my life with his words,Killing me softly with his song,Killing me softly with his song,Telling my whole life with his words,Killing me softly with his songI felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on.Strumming my pain with his fingers,Singing my life with his words,Killing me softly with his song,Killing me softly with his song,Telling my whole life with his words,Killing me softly with his songHe sang as if he knew me in all my dark despairAnd then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there.But he just came to singing, singing clear and strong.Strumming my pain with his fingers,Singing my life with his words,Killing me softly with his song,Killing me softly with his song,Telling my whole life with his words,Killing me softly with his song

The shadow of your smile( Love Theme From " The Sandpiper")
One day we walked along the sandOne day in early springYou held a piper in your handTo mend its broken wingNow I'll remember many a dayAnd many a lonely mileThe echo of a piper's songThe shadow of a smileThe shadow of your smileWhen you are goneWill color all my dreamsAnd light the dawnLook into my eyesMy love and seeAll the lovely thingsYou are to meOur wistful little starWas far too highA teardrop kissed your lipsAnd so did INow when I remember springAll the joy that love can bringI will be rememberingThe shadow of your smile

The Battle of New Orleans
Well, in 18 and 14, we took a little trip‚Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip'.We took a little bacon and we took a little beans‚And we met the bloody British in the town of New Orleans. We fired our guns and the British kept a comin'.There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.We fired once more and they began a runningDown the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Well, I seed Mars Jackson come a-walkin' down the street,And a-talkin' to a pirate by the name of Jean Lafitte;He gave Jean a drink that he brung from Tennessee,And the pirate said he'd help us drive the British to the sea.  Well, the French told Andrew: "You had better runFor Packenham's a-comin' with a bullet in his gun."Old Hickory said he didn't give a damn,He's a-gonna whup the britches off of Colonel Packenham. Well, we looked down the river and we seed the British come,And there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drum.They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring,While we stood behind our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.  Old Hickory said we could take'em by surpriseIf we didn't fire a musket till we looked'em in the eyes.We held our fire till we seed their face well.Then we opened up our squirrel guns and really gave'em well.  Well, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles.And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.They ran so fast the hounds couldn't catch'emDown the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Well‚ we fired our cannons till the barrels melted down.So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round.We filled his head with minie balls and powdered his behind,And when we touched the powder off, the 'gator lost his mind. They lost their pants and their pretty shiny coats,And their tails was all a-showin' like a bunch of billy goats.They ran down the river with their tongues a-hanging out,And they said they got a lickin', which there wasn't any doubt.  Well, we marched back to town in our dirty ragged pants,And we danced all night with the pretty girls from France;We couldn't understand'em, but they had the sweetest charms,And we understood'em better when we got'em in our arms.  Well, the guide who brung the British from the seaCome a-limping into camp just as sick as he could be,He said the dying words of Colonel PackenhamWas: "You better quit your foolin' with your cousin Uncle Sam." Well, we'll march back home, but we'll never be contentTill we make Old Hick'ry the people's president.And every time‚ we think about the bacon and the beans‚We'll think about the fun we had way down in New Orleans.
